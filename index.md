# Xinyu Su
_PhD candidate of the University of Melbourne, Computing and Information Systems._  
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne, supervised by A/Prof Jianzhong Qi, Prof Egemen Tanin, Prof Majid Sarvi and Dr Feng Liu. My research focuses on accurate spatial–temporal data mining with noisy and incomplete data.

From 2018 - 2020, I received my MSc in Applied Statistics from the School of Data Science, Fudan University, under the supervision of Prof Xiangyang Xue and Bin li, where I worked on computer vision. Between 2014 - 2018, I earned my dual bachelor’s degrees in Software Engineering and Financial Engineering from Sichuan University, as part of the Honours Engineering Program. 
Before my doctoral study, I worked as a Data Analyst at the Sichuan Branch of China Construction Bank, where I specialised in financial data analytics and risk modelling.
