# Suzy Su
_PhD candidate in Computing and Information Systems._  
I build **spatial–temporal forecasting** models for traffic networks, with an emphasis on **unobserved regions**, physics‑guided constraints, and **fast hybrid spatial indices**.

## News
- **Nov 2025** — Our paper on physics‑guided cross‑domain forecasting was accepted. 🎉
- **Oct 2025** — Released FHSIE, a fast hybrid spatial index with external‑memory support.

## Research Interests
- Spatial–temporal forecasting and transfer to **unobserved regions**
- Physics‑guided learning (e.g., **LWR** constraints)
- Embeddings and dynamic grouping for networks
- Learned spatial indices (FHSIE) and large‑scale data systems
