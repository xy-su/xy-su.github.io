_PhD Candidate, Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne_

I am a PhD candidate at the **University of Melbourne**, supervised by  
**A/Prof Jianzhong Qi**, **Prof Egemen Tanin**, **Prof Majid Sarvi**, and **Dr Feng Liu**.  
My research focuses on **accurate spatial–temporal data mining** under **noisy and incomplete data** conditions.

From **2018 – 2020**, I completed my **MSc in Applied Statistics** at the **School of Data Science, Fudan University**, under the supervision of **Prof Xiangyang Xue** and **Prof Bin Li**, where I worked on **computer vision**.  
Between **2014 – 2018**, I earned **dual bachelor’s degrees** in **Software Engineering** and **Financial Engineering** from **Sichuan University**, as part of the **Honours Engineering Program**.  
Before my doctoral study, I worked as a **Data Analyst** at the **Sichuan Branch of China Construction Bank**, specialising in **financial data analytics and risk modelling**.
